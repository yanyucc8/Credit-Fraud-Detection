## Credit-Fraud-Detection

As we all know credit card fraud detection will have a imbalanced data i.e having more number of normal class than the number of fraud class
In this I will use Basic method of handling imbalance data.

**Undersampling**:- it means taking the less number of majority class (In our case taking less number of Normal transactions so that our new data will be balanced

**Oversampling**: it means using replicating the data of minority class (fraud class) so that we can have a balanced data

**SMOTE**: it is also a type of oversampling but in this we will make the synthetic example of Minority data and will give as a balanced data

I will start with the Oversampling and will try to classify using these Models:

  * Logistic regression

  * Decision Tree Classifier/ Random Forest Classifier

  * SVM

  * Adaboost
